Local API Usage for Free@Home from ABB
=======================================
This was in preparation for [JonasOS](https://github.com/JonasHeilig/JonasOS) because I want to implement a SmartHome control system in my personal Assistant. <br>

You only need to install requests (`pip install requests`)

In this Test Repository I have implemented the following functions:
- Get General Information
- Get all devices
- Get all devoces to file
- Send notification
- toggle light

Not all Skripts are working with all SysAPs versions.
